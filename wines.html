                        <h4>Tannin provides the backbone of red wine, which is why you might describe a red wine as “firm” or “leathery” or just plain “bitter.” Tannin also gives red wine texture, making it feel “smooth” and “soft” or “rough” and “chewy.” In general, the darker the wine, the higher the tannin and the “bolder” the taste.<a href="https://www.primermagazine.com/2022/learn/different-wine-types">Read More</a></h4>

                        <h4>Rosé, or blush wine, is pink in color. It gets that way because it is allowed to stay in contact with the red grape skins for a relatively short time compared to red wine. On the spectrum between red and white, rosé is much closer to the light side, with relatively low tannin. <a href="https://www.primermagazine.com/2022/learn/different-wine-types">Read More</a></h4>
